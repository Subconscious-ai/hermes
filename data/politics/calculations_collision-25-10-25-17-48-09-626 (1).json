to interpret: The study reveals that the feature levels influencing New York voter likelihood to support Mamdandi are the following:\n• Housing Affordability Commitment: Increasing housing commitments cause substantial preference gains, with a 54% increase when moving from minimal new builds (-0.14) to comprehensive plans (0.40), demonstrating ambitious housing targets directly enhance voter support.\n• Public Safety Investment Level: Higher investment levels cause significant preference increases, with a 47% improvement when moving from low enforcement (<10% budget at -0.06) to robust security (20-25% budget at 0.41), though maximum protection shows diminishing returns with an 8% decrease.\n• Economic Development Focus: Job creation targets cause moderate preference variations, with a 23% increase when moving from limited targets (0-5000 jobs at 0.04) to steady growth (5000-10000 jobs at 0.26), though higher targets plateau with minimal additional gains.\n• Transportation Infrastructure Budget: Increased spending causes preference gains up to a point, with a 33% increase when moving from basic maintenance ($0-1B at 0.11) to incremental upgrades ($1-3B at 0.44), but preference decreases by 17% with full overhaul spending ($10-20B at 0.27).\n• Free buses: Complete fare elimination causes minimal preference impact, with only a 10% difference between maintaining current fares (0.03) and complete elimination (0.08), indicating this policy has limited influence on voter support.\n• Rent Freezes: Extended freeze periods cause moderate preference increases, with a 12% improvement when moving from no freeze (0.03) to 3-year freeze with exceptions (0.15), though shorter freezes show minimal impact.\n• City Run Grocery Stores: Pilot programs cause preference increases, with a 17% improvement when moving from comprehensive networks (-0.01) to pilot programs (0.16), suggesting voters prefer targeted rather than expansive government retail intervention."],"AMCE_graph_title":["Relative Effect of Policy Positions and Messaging Tone on NY Voter Support for Mamdandi"],"Utility":[{"attribute_text":"Housing Affordability

fundamental urban policy priorities rather than specific progressive initiatives:\n\n• Housing affordability commitment (25%) emerges as the most critical factor, indicating that voters view housing as the primary policy challenge that directly impacts their daily lives and voting decisions.\n\n• Public safety investment (21%) and transportation infrastructure budget (21%) are equally important, demonstrating that voters prioritize basic municipal services and infrastructure as core governmental responsibilities.\n\n• Economic development focus (12%) serves as a secondary consideration, suggesting that while important, it acts more as a differentiating factor rather than a primary decision driver for voter support.\n\n• Progressive-specific policies like rent freezes (8%), city-run

Housing Policy Priority: Make housing affordability the centerpiece of Mamdandi's campaign platform, emphasizing comprehensive plans for new housing development rather than minimal commitments. This should be the primary focus of campaign messaging and policy proposals, as it accounts for 25% of voter decision-making.\n\n2. Balanced Public Safety Investment: Advocate for robust public safety spending in the 20-25% budget range, avoiding both minimal enforcement approaches and excessive maximum protection measures. Frame this as responsible investment in community security without overreach.\n\n3. Infrastructure Investment Strategy: Propose moderate transportation infrastructure spending ($1-3B range) focused on incremental upgrades rather than massive overhaul projects. This approach maximizes voter appeal while demonstrating fiscal responsibility.\n\n4. Pragmatic Messaging Tone: Emphasize practical, achievable solutions over progressive reform rhetoric. Focus campaign communications on delivering results for fundamental urban challenges rather than ideological positioning.\n\n5. Strategic Progressive Policies: Use targeted progressive initiatives like pilot city-run grocery programs and limited rent freeze measures as supplementary policy positions rather than campaign cornerstones.
