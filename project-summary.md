Product Summary (User-Focused, 1â€“3 Sentences)
Our tool stops marketers from guessing what copy will convert. It uses behavioral simulation to find the most persuasive message for their specific audience, and then generates a ready-to-send email campaign with a full explanation of its reasoning. We transform a week of painful A/B testing into a 10-minute, data-driven workflow.
Primary ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
Job title(s): Marketing Manager, Growth Marketer, or Content Marketer at a B2B Tech Startup (Seed to Series B).
Their role in the workflow: This person is the "doer." They are directly responsible for writing the copy, building the campaigns in an email platform, and reporting on the results.
Who they collaborate with during this part of the workflow: They receive strategic goals from a Head of Marketing/VP of Marketing and often work with Sales Development Reps (SDRs) who need effective email templates for outreach.
Current Responsibilities & Tools
This user is responsible for generating qualified leads and nurturing them through the marketing funnel. Their primary tool for this is email marketing.
Current Tools: HubSpot, Mailchimp, or Marketo for sending emails; Google Docs or Notion for drafting copy; Jasper or Copy.ai for brainstorming; LinkedIn Sales Navigator for audience research.
How they get this part of their job done today: The process is a manual, opinion-driven cycle of drafting, getting feedback, and running slow A/B tests to see what message resonates with customers.
How the Process Works Today (Step-by-Step)
Receives a brief: "We need a campaign for our new AI-powered analytics feature."
Spends hours brainstorming angles and writing two different versions of the email copy in Google Docs.
Asks for feedback from sales and leadership, receiving conflicting opinions.
Sets up a 50/50 A/B test in HubSpot, sending the two versions to a small segment of the audience.
Waits 1-2 weeks for the test to collect enough data to be statistically significant.
Analyzes the results, which are often inconclusive (e.g., Version A has a better open rate, but Version B has a better click-through rate).
Picks a "winner" based on a gut feeling and sends it to the rest of the email list, hoping for the best.
Key Problems or Frustrations (Bullet Points)
Extremely slow feedback loops: It takes weeks to know if a message is effective, which is too slow for a fast-moving startup.
Wasted effort: 50% of the creative energy and time is spent on an underperforming "B-variant" that gets discarded.
Opinion-driven decisions: The "best" copy is often chosen based on the loudest voice in the room, not data about the customer.
Lack of confidence: They launch major campaigns with no real certainty if the core message will land, creating significant performance anxiety.
Risk of audience fatigue: Sending poorly optimized emails leads to low engagement, hurting sender reputation and burning out their valuable email list.
Professional Goals & Motivations (Bullet Points)
Hit their numbers: Their success is measured by metrics like Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs), demo requests, and pipeline generated.
Prove their impact: They want to show that their marketing efforts are directly contributing to revenue.
Be more strategic: They want to spend less time on tedious copywriting and A/B test setup, and more time on high-level campaign strategy.
Achieve predictable results: They crave a reliable system for generating high-performing campaigns without the guesswork.
New Process (Step-by-Step)
Opens our tool, "Campaign Co-Pilot."
Enters the product feature they're promoting and provides 3-4 LinkedIn URLs of their ideal customer profile.
Inputs a few potential messaging angles they're curious about (e.g., "save time" vs. "reduce risk").
Clicks "Generate Campaign."
Instantly reviews the "Reasoning Report," which explains the single most persuasive message for that audience and why.
Copies the ready-to-send, three-part email campaign that has been generated based on that core insight.
Loads the campaign into HubSpot and sends it with high confidence, knowing the message is pre-validated to resonate.
Solution Hypothesis
We believe that an AI co-pilot that combines behavioral simulation with generative AI will help startup marketing managers solve the problem of writing email campaigns that actually convert by first identifying the most persuasive messaging angle and then instantly writing the copy, showing its reasoning throughout.
Assumption to Test:
If we provide a data-backed, ready-to-send email campaign with a clear explanation of why it works, then marketing teams will be willing to adopt it to accelerate their campaign creation process.
Hypothesized Outcomes (KPIs):
Estimated time saved for user: Reduce campaign creation and validation time from 1-2 weeks to under 15 minutes.
Increased conversion or throughput: Increase key email metrics (reply rates, demo bookings) by using copy that is scientifically pre-validated for the target audience.
Error reduction / improved accuracy: Eliminate wasted resources and creative effort spent writing, testing, and sending ineffective B-variant copy.
