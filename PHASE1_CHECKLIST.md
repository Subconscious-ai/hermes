# Phase 1 Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Completed Items

- [x] Virtual environment created
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [x] `.gitignore` configured
- [x] `.env` file created
- [x] `mock_response.json` created with API contract
- [x] `main.py` with FastAPI app and mock endpoint
- [x] `vercel.json` deployment configuration
- [x] `setup_database.sql` for Supabase
- [x] Local server running on http://localhost:8000

## 🎯 Next Actions (In Order)

### Account Setup (10 minutes)

- [ ] Create Supabase account
- [ ] Create new Supabase project
- [ ] Run `setup_database.sql` in SQL Editor
- [ ] Copy Supabase URL and Anon Key to `.env`

- [ ] Get OpenAI API key
- [ ] Add to `.env`

- [ ] Get Subconscious API key
- [ ] Add to `.env`

### Deployment (5 minutes)

- [ ] Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
- [ ] Login: `vercel login`
- [ ] Deploy: `vercel --prod`
- [ ] Copy deployment URL

### Communication (2 minutes)

- [ ] Share Vercel URL with front-end developer
- [ ] Confirm they can call `/generate-campaign-mock`
- [ ] Confirm they have the API contract from `mock_response.json`

## 🔥 Front-End Can Start Now!

Once you share the Vercel URL, your front-end developer can:
- Build the input form
- Connect to `/generate-campaign-mock`
- Build the results screen
- All WITHOUT waiting for the real backend!

## 🛠️ Your Next Work (Backend)

While front-end builds, you implement:
1. Subconscious API integration
2. OpenAI API integration
3. Supabase save functionality
4. The real `/generate-campaign` endpoint

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Server won't start?**
- Check port 8000 is free
- Verify virtual environment is activated
- Run: `.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py`

**Mock endpoint not working?**
- Ensure `mock_response.json` is in root directory
- Check file has valid JSON
- Visit http://localhost:8000/docs to test

**Deployment failing?**
- Verify `vercel.json` is in root
- Check `requirements.txt` exists
- Ensure you're logged into Vercel
