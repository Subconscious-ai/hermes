#### D. The Emails
> "And here are the actual emails - notice how each one is crafted for a specific psychological profile:
>
> - Different subjects

## Technical Talking Points (If Asked)

### "How does the behavioral analysis work?"

> "We use conjoint analysis - the same technique used by Fortune 500 companies to understand consumer preferences. We simulate how your target audience trades off different product attributes and messaging angles, then identify which combinations drive the highest engagement."

### "What's the AI stack?"

> "GPT-4 for content generation, but the magic is in the **behavioral insight extraction**. The AI isn't just writing emails - it's writing emails **informed by psychological data** about your specific audience."

### "How accurate is this?"

> "Our analysis is based on simulations across thousands of decision-making scenarios with high confidence levels. The mock data we're showing is structured identically to real Subconscious API data, which aggregates behavioral patterns across large audience samples."

### "Can I use my own behavioral data?"

> "Yes! Once you have access to the Subconscious API, just swap in your experiment ID. The entire workflow stays the same - we just use real behavioral data instead of simulations."

## Demo Recovery (If Something Breaks)

### If API call fails:
> "Let me show you a pre-generated example..." 
> 
> â†’ Open `campaign_result.json` and walk through it

### If server is slow:
> "While we wait, let me explain what makes this different from ChatGPT. Anyone can ask ChatGPT to write emails. Hermes uses **behavioral science** to know WHICH emails to write and WHY they'll work."

## Follow-Up Questions to Anticipate

**Q: How is this different from just using ChatGPT?**  
A: ChatGPT guesses. Hermes **analyzes** your audience's psychology first, then generates content based on proven behavioral patterns. It's the difference between creative writing and data-driven copywriting.

**Q: How much does it cost?**  
A: ~$0.03 per campaign for the AI generation. The behavioral analysis depends on sample size, but typically ranges from $5-50 per audience study.

**Q: How long does it take?**  
A: 10-30 seconds for the full workflow. Compare that to days or weeks of traditional campaign development.

**Q: Does it work for industries beyond education?**  
A: Absolutely! Any B2B product where you understand your target audience. SaaS, professional services, enterprise software - anywhere psychology drives decisions.

**Q: What if my audience is different than the example?**  
A: That's the point! Just provide your audience's LinkedIn URLs and product description. The behavioral analysis is custom to YOUR specific market.
